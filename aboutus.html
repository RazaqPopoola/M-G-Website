		<h2><span class="label label-default">Who We Are</span></h2>
			<p>
				M&G Natureworks International Research Institute is a knowledge based Institute that is committed to Research and Development (R&D) 
				result. The Institute is a private research institute approved by the government under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of 
				Science and Technology via its Presidential Standing Committee on Invention and Innovation (PSCII). Our scientific advancement of 
				research on Green Diamond and Liquid Food products and medicines has earned us as esteem. 
				beneficiaries of the PSCII. This is evident on partnership with the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, which is the pivot of Nigeria economic development.

		<h2><span class="label label-default">Our Mandate</span></h2>
			<p>
				Our primary mandate is to continue to save lives of people through the use of production of our research findings on natural health foods, juices, teas and medicine that can improve the quality of lives of our people in Nigeria and Africa and also through community outreaches.<br><br>
				To provide food, clothing and shelter to less privileged people especially women and children scourged by poverty, hunger or crisis in Africa and to also provide free medical treatment to save them from disease pandemics such as malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid and HIV.<br><br>
				We want to help Nigeria to achieve self- sufficiency in the area of preventive and primary healthcare through the use of Green Diamond Health Products.<br><br>
				To help Nigerian populace to understand what is locally available and obtainable in LifeSaver Health Foods and Teas Clinic.<br><br>
				This laudable project will reduce the heavy burden of importation on the Governments in Nigeria once it is opened all over our capital cities in Nigeria.<br><br>
				Our goal is to mass produce these organic foods, juices, teas, liquid meals and medicines in Nigeria to save the lives of our people especially children and young mothers that are dying as a result of stress related diseases such as High Blood Pressure, Diabetes, Heart failure, Kidney failure and Cancer.<br><br>
				Our formula is without side effect, this is because they are natural-based foods and health products that will save the lives of Nigerians. This will also reduce the rate at which Nigerians travel abroad for medical attention. Also, other sickness and diseases that are ravaging Nigeria such as HIV/AIDS and Diabetes even in children as a result of regular intake of soda-based drinks and inorganic foods that they are exposed to on a daily basis will be reduced.<br><br>
				We have opened officially a pilot project, the LifeSaver Health Food Clinic later in the year 2012 at the Head of Civil Service, in the Federal Capital of Nigeria, Abuja.<br><br>
				We employ this outreach to relieve the Nigerian people of diseases that are plaguing our economy and reducing productivity through healthy diets foods, natural juices and teas with no chemical additives. The initiative has been a profound success thanks to positive impact in the lives of frequenting customers.<br><br>
				We believe with more enlightenment and expansion, we can reduce mortality rates due to poor diets, hygiene and illness through this laudable project.
